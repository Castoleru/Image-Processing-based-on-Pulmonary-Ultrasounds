# Image-Processing-based-on-Pulmonary-Ultrasounds

The basic idea of this project is to detect the pulmonary affected area caused by cancer. In the "(Romanian) Documentatie Proiect" I had explained all my algorithms used for this project. 
Here I will post two photos. First is the nonedited photo and the second is the edited one.
